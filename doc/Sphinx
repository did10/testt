# Why use this?

This Wiki uses Sphinx and GitHub pages for hosting. Shinx is a python documentation server.
It is quite customizable and also supports mermaid, you can also export to PDF.
It is the most refined one, I guess. 
Because it is a python tool someone has to host it. This can either be a (network) local service (self hosted), or can be on GitHub pages (public if not using enterprice version).
